Below is the score breakdown for the workflow and formatting aspects of your proposal. Separate issues provide details of what needs to be updated/revised. As you address them, you should close the individual issues. 

You can do this in one of two ways: on GitHub by clicking on Close issue or via a commit that directly addresses the issue. Weâ€™ll practice the second one. If you preface your commits with "Fixes", "Fixed", "Fix", "Closes", "Closed", or "Close", the issue will be closed when you push the changes to your repo. For example, suppose you want to close issue #2 which suggested that you add a new line to the README, your commit message can say something like `Add a new line to the README, closes #2`.

Once you've closed all the other issues, close this one as well so that there are no open issues when you reach your next project milestone.
